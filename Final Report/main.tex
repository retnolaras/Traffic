\section{Introduction}

[Todo: opening paragraph]

The report have seven sections. The first section is an introduction to the project, including the background, description, objectives, scope and methodology. In the second section we will talk about the literature and application that we reviewed in the preparation of the project. The third section will explains the requirements and designs of this project. The fourth section will explains the detail implementations, from overall architecture to the each (?) of the development, including the development adjustment that we made through out the project. The fifth section will explain about the team work and the work load division. In the sixth section we will discuss about the project evaluation, such as the system test, lesson learn, and possible future works. All additional documents thats relevant will be in section seven, for instance class diagrams,package diagram and Gantt chart. 

\subsection{Background}
Traffic simulation software plays an important role in defining the effective traffic management policies. A traffic policy must be simulated and verified before it is actually implemented in real life. Otherwise, it might harm road users’ safety and traffic efficiency. There are a lot of factors contributing to road accidents and traffic efficiency. The major factors include speed, traffic light timing and driver’s behaviours. For instance, in 2013, in the UK, 3,064 people were killed or seriously injured in crashes where speed was a factor.
Therefore, this project will simulate traffic management policies focusing on those 3 main factors ie. Speed limit; Traffic light timing; Driver's behaviours. The software will test different policies relating to these factors and analyse the traffic efficiency and safety in relation to traffic density, enforcement policy and driver's behaviours.

The analysis will be based on the average speed: average speed of vehicles in a session. This metric is to measure traffic efficiency and reliability.

In this report, we will explain how our traffic simulator works and how the simulator implements (what we implement? what our purposes)
	
\subsection{Descriptions}
%description of the project
This system will try to simulate the traffic with.

\subsection{Objectives}
Our initial objectives for this project where as follows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Develop traffic simulator program with functional road system with vehicles, roads, junctions, intersections and traffic lights.
\item Analyse how the simulator working in emergency situation by creating emergency vehicle in the simulation session. (?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}
The software is to simulate the traffic management policy following UK highway code which is left-lane oriented and using the speed limit within the range of speed limit defined in the UK highway code.
Within the constraints of time and resources, the project's scope includes:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Controlled Map: Minimum multiple-lane roads and a junction. It should support the scalability to a complex traffic network (ie. Multiple roundabouts, multiple junctions, multiple traffic lights, bus lane).
\item Vehicles: Simulate multiple types of vehicles, which include at least cars and ambulances (emergency vehicle) and at least three classes of driver’s behaviours (reckless, cautious, normal).
\item Policy: the project must support at least fixed control policy (traffic light timing, speed limit). It should be scalable to variable control policy.
\item Simulation engine: must test the policies with different levels of traffic density.
\item Report: Must provide the statistics and calculates metrics as above.
\end{itemize}

\section{Review}

One of the traffic simulator reviewed was by Namekawa et al \cite{NameUeda05}. Even though there was a lot of road traffic simulation developed before, almost all them were developed with specific areas so they cannot be reused for simulation in the other area. Namekawa et al tried to create a general simulation system to analyse road traffic congestion of arbitrary areas. The general traffic simulation also wished to be not too complicated, with shorter simulation process time. They modeled the road network with such variable width portions that divided into three kinds of sub-roads as two side lines and a center line and also used a model of a cell automaton as one technique to realize microscopic model road traffic simulation in a city. [PARAPHRASING NEED]. [need to add more?]

From this system, the group got an insight to how to build the road network for a traffic simulation.  We also created different types of lanes to accommodate the traffic lane change. MiddleLane as the center line, LeftLane and RightLane as the side line. 

The other paper that reviewed was by Sewall et al \cite{SewWilMer10}. They modeled detailed 3D animations and visualization of traffic flows, fast method for efficient simulations of large-scale, real-world networks of traffic using continuum dynamics that maintains discrete vehicle information to display each vehicle.
Sewall approached this by adapting a single-lane continuum flow model to handle multi-lane traffic by introducing a novel model of lane changes and using a discrete visual representation for each vehicle and then compared the result with agent-based methods. [I don't know what we got from here?]

\section{Implementation} 
% st significant implementation details, focusing on those where unusual or detailed solutions were required. Quote code fragments where necessary, but remember that the full source code will be included as an appendix. Explain how you tested your software (e.g. unit testing) and the extent to which you tested it. If relevant to your project, explain performance issues and how you tackled them.
% This section of the report shall discusses the actual implementation of the traffic simulator system. The section will begin by discussing the initial prototypes that were developed and follow up with the technical discussion of the final implemented system.

This section of the report discusses about some of the implementation details that are deemed important to the project. The section is divided into different subsections.
\subsection{Overall Architecture}
This project was developed in Java. We decided to use Model-View-Controller(MVC) as the architectural pattern, and Singleton as the creational pattern. It is common to think of an application as having three main
layers such as presentation or user interface, application logic, and resource management. In MVC, the presentation
layer is split into controller and view. The most important separation is between presentation and
application logic. MVC encompasses more of the architecture of an application than is typical for a design pattern. Hence the term architectural pattern may be useful, or perhaps an aggregate design pattern.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Model: The domain-specific representation of the information on which the application operates.
    The model is another name for the application logic layer (sometimes also called the
    domain layer). Application (or domain) logic adds meaning to raw data (e.g., calculating if today
    is the user’s birthday, or the totals, taxes and shipping charges for shopping cart items).
    Many applications use a persistent storage mechanism (such as a database) to store data.
    MVC does not specifically mention the resource management layer because it is understood
    to be underneath or encapsulated by the Model.
    \item View: Renders the model into a form suitable for interaction, typically a user interface
    element.
    \item Controller : Processes and responds to events, typically user actions, and may invoke changes
    on the model and view.
    \end{itemize}

The control flow in MVC generally works with the user interacts with the user interface in some way, a controller handles the input event from the user interface, and the controller accesses the model. In our application, (?)
Simulation Engine as the Controller, Vehicle, Policy and Road Network as the Model and the GUI as the View (?).

Vehicle here is a component in which the simulation will analyse. We created enumerator files such as Behaviour for driver behaviour, Direction for the information of the direction that the vehicle take, and VehicleType to differentiate between Car, Bus, and Emergency Vehicle. We decided that the vehicle object would not be the one that makes decision of how and where to go. All logic goes to SimulationEngine.

\item \textbf{Context} 
\item \textbf{SimulationEngine} is the engine that control the entire system and simulation.
\item \textbf{Context} is the list for all needed information.
\item \textbf{SimulationData} is the class for collecting all the data during the simulation iteration. Data including the number of vehicles, the number of vehicle that succeeded to arrived at the their destination, average speed from all the vehicles, the number of crashed between vehicle, and the traffic estimation. The detail calculation method for the traffic estimation will be discuss in \ref{rte}.
\end{itemize}.

\subsubsection{Road Traffic Estimation} \label{rte}
The methodology to calculate the road traffic estimation we derived from annual series of road traffic estimation that published by the Department for Transport. We simplified and did several adjustment to our simulation data to get the estimation number. Department of Transport uses manual traffic counts. this data then combined with information from a network of automatic traffic counter (ATCs) to calculate a series of annual average daily flows (AADF) for each count point. These daily flows then combined with road lengths to calculate the number of vehicle miles travelled each year by vehicle types, road category and region. In the document AADF major and minor road are separated as traffic volume is calculated differently for major and minor roads, however, for our calculation we use the simulation data. For every tick represent as 25,000,000 nanosecond, so we need 144 minutes to simulate 24 hours traffic. 
to convert the AADFs into traffic volume we multiply AADF with the link length, we then multiply it by the number of days in the year (365) to get an annual total. Link length is the total length of the network road link in km. For each lane section that we have, we decided that it will represent 3 meter in real life. Therefore, the link length calculate that from the number of lane section in the map and we multiply it by 0.003 km. 
\subsection{Development Adjustment}
Several functions that we planned in our iteration before that changed
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item No Vehicle Bus 
	\item No Vehicle Emergency
	\item No Roundabout  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Team Work}
%Describe how you worked together, including the tools and processes you used to facilitate group work.
On the first sprint, or iteration 1, we managed to do almost all the tasks that we listed before. Since it's still initiation state, we mostly created different classes and objects that we thought we will need later. Files from policy (Policy, Speedlimit, Trafficlight), GUI (UIComponent, drawUI), road network (AbstractLaneSection, LaneFactory, LaneSection, LeftLane, MiddleLane, RightLane, SingleLane, ListOfListRoadImpl, Road, RoadFactory), main (SessionManager, SimulatorEngine, TrafficSimulatorApplication), and vehicle (Behaviour, Bus, Car, Direction, Emergency, Point, Vehicle, VehicleFactory, VehicleType). We also created JUnit test files for unit testing such as testpolicy, testlanesection, sessionmanagersprtest, sessionmanagertest and testvehicle. 

In the end of iteration 1 we decided to change our designed by moving all the control from the engine to the vehicle. Therefore the vehicle itself would have the method to accelerate and decelerate, and the behaviour towards traffic light. The decision making will still be on simulation engine but the behaviour will be declared on the vehicle itself. 
For the iteration 2, we added new classes. Files from: policy (TrafficLightColour), and roadnetwork (Junction, PrePlannedRouteJunction, TrafficLight). We also developed the GUI class again from scratch, because in iteration 1 we still unsure about the detail design and how the data flow will work from the simulation engine to the UI component. We deleted UIComponent and drawUI, and added GUIComponent, InitScreen, integertextfield, irenderer, simulationrender, simulationsetting). However, some of the tasks that we designated for this iteration could not be done and moved to the next sprint/iteration.  

We used Trello for the project management. Tasks in each iterations breaks down and assigned it to member. In the end of each iteration we have a meeting to discuss what are the tasks that we need to do for the next iteration. We created a list for each iteration, and wrote cards to put the task in. After the task is done, we can move it to the DONE list, so we know which task that have not finished yet. The unfinished task then moved to the next iteration, and added as the new workload.

In initial planning, we intend to have biweekly meeting, on Monday and Thursday. However, during development phase, we had a meeting almost three or four times a week, and increased to meet five to six times a week starting in iteration 3. We used the whatsapp group to arranged the meeting time and place. 

We used sharelatex to edit our final report together. This collaboration application work better than what we did for our initial report. We divided our part for the initial report into two groups, project description and project organisation. We then worked it separately and combined it in Github. This method appeared to created a lot of problem. We had a lot of document conflicts, from five people doing the edit the same file. Sharelatex is a good solution for this problem, since the group can collaborate in parallel and stimultaniously. 

\subsection{Work Load Division:}
Since the project will be relatively of small to medium size, in our initial planning, we decided that the group will facilitate job rotation at every iteration of development. This will be done to increase depth and breadth of understanding of the project by all members, as well as allow for a more flexible work distribution. In our first iteration we divided the tasks to 5 important components, such as Session Manager, Vehicle, Policy, Road, and GUI.

This strategy works perfectly fine until the end of iteration 2, but in the beginning of iteration 3, we change strategy to stop rotating the roles, and stick to the area because the deadline was approaching. The problem about this strategy is that we spend a lot of time to discuss specific logic together, rather than use the time to develop the code. We also need time to explaining the logic that the previous programmer to the next programmer.

\subsection{Future Work} 
%How the project could be extended
One of the most challenging aspects of any project is imagining what could be done, if the project was taken up by another team of engineers after the original team moves on to pastures new.
\\~\\
The team has discovered several paths that could be followed. Each of which would advance the base project into more specialized areas.
They can be broken down into two categories. Engineering improvements and Data gathering/simulation improvements.

\paragraph{Engineering}
Engineering improvements involve changes to the system Software that could better utilize engineering principals and practices.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Parallelism:}
	\\~\\
	Parallelism has emerged as an important concept in engineering, and more specifically in traffic simulation. Liu \cite{website:phy-ntnu-traffic-simulation} makes parallelism the key purpose of their project. Taking advantage of machines with multiple cores could allow for faster and more detailed simulations to be run. Perhaps by allowing vehicles or other objects within the simulation to be built as individual threads which would allow vehicles to act independently and concurrently within a map. Also by separating out the concerns of data gathering and simulation, if different threads were responsible for either aspect they could be more specialised.
	
	However it also requires more attention to detail when designing and writing code. As you must take care to synchronise shared data items to avoid pitfalls like deadlock and race conditions. This increased burden was one of the reasons the team decided against parallelization in their original project.
	
	The project's use of Java as it's primary programming language would allow future developers a convenient way into introducing parallelism. Java includes native, as well as third party, support for parallelism, such as the Fork/Join framework\cite{LeaForkJoin} as well as the new Java 8 Streams functionality\cite{website:Oracle-Java-8}, as well as native control libraries for concurrency controls.
	
	The modular approach the team took to designing the system architecture also facilitates the introduction of parallelism, because different modules could be parallelised independently.
	\\While the Test Driven Development approach would allow iterative introduction of parallelisation with the capacity to test if the new developments fit in with the accepted functionality tested in the original test suites.
	
	\item \textbf{Use of External Libraries:}
	\\ Another future improvement would be to include libraries and code from outside sources. Most notably, visualisation and data gathering and analysis tools. Visualisation tools could improve the user experience by allowing a more immersive interaction with the simulation. The visualisation provided by the TransModeler Project project \cite{website:caliper.com-transmodeler} is a good example of how improving visualisation is key to an enjoyable, productive, and useful piece of Traffic Simulation software.
	\item \textbf{Distibuted Road Network:}
	\item \textbf{User defined maps:} 
	\\@TODO
	\\add user designed maps
	\item \textbf{Integration with Third party APIs:} 
	\\@TODO
	\\add draw maps from google maps API or something similar
\end{enumerate}

	
\subsection{Peer Assessment}
@TODO
	%In a simple table, allocate the 100 ‘points’ you are given to each team member. Valid values range from 0 to 100 inclusive. You may assign decimal values, but the entire points must add up to precisely 100. As stated at the beginning of the project, when awarding points to each member it would based on contribution, ...below is the grade table for each member totalling up to 100. 
\\As stated in the initial report peer assessment would be based on how much each team member was able to contribute based on their individual skills.
